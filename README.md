### A simple game made for my web programming course where the main task is to collect as many stars as possible while staying alive
#### The player has to avoid the monsters while climbing the rocks. There are 2 types of rocks: regular and cracked, the cracked rocks disappear after a touch and give the player a boost. The monsters should be avoided, however, if the player has collected a syringe it can touch the monster without losing. The regular stars(golden) give 1 point and the orange ones give 5. Also, the actions happen in space where the oxygen is limited so keep an eye on the right corner and collect the oxygen as often as possible
